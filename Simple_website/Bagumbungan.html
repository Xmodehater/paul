        For those who like to experience spelunking in the Philippines,
        you can check out one of Marinduque’s subterranean wonders, the Bagumbungan Cave.
        It is often compared to Sumaguing Cave in Sagada because of its stalactites and stalagmites in impressive shapes and forms.
        Bagumbungan Cave is a great spelunking spot that features magnificent rock formations.

        The jump-off point is at the Santa Cruz town where the cave is located. At the cave’s entrance,
        there is a pathway leading down the waist-deep underground river basin.
        To get there, you have to pass through slippery surfaces and narrow passages.
        The path gets a bit more challenging as you slide down the muddy paths and squeeze yourself between huge rocks.

        <br>
        Bagumbungan Cave is 1.9KM long and has a beginner-friendly trail, ideal for those who are new to spelunking.
        Some parts of the cave are off-limits for tourists. It remains largely unexplored, making it a wonderland for adventure seekers out there.
