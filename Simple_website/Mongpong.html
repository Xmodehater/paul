Off the northeastern coast of Marinduque is Mongpong Island, 
a charming islet with striking rock formations and a pristine white-sand beach.
It has clear blue waters where you can see through colorful reef fishes underwater.
</br>
<br>
Upon arrival on the island, the Ungab Rock Formation is the first thing that will pique your interest.
The huge colossal rock sits on the islandâ€™s turquoise waters and white sand.
Carved out of the base rock is a triangular hole that forms a land bridge connecting you to the other side of the beach.  
</br>
<br>
The giant boulder is a sight to behold and a perfect backdrop for your selfies and group photos. 
Plus, the water underneath the rock arch is shallow, making it a safe spot to swim for kids.
The white sand is also a mixture of smooth pebbles and coral fragments.
